# Create a quote

With the **{{resource:Common_Product_Name_Variable_eAccQuoteOrder}}** feature in **{{resource:Common_Company_Name_Short}}**, you get full control over your entire sales process, from the initial proposal to the final order confirmation. By working with quotes, you give your customers a professional impression and can easily follow up on your business opportunities directly in your accounting platform.

If you haven't already activated the feature, you can add it under ****{{resource:inapp_hdr_selectedAddons}}**** in the menu on the left.

## How to do it

1. Go to **Sales** and select **Quotes**.
2. Click the **New quote** button.
3. Select the customer you want to send the quote to in the **Customer** field.
4. Check the **Quote date**. The **Valid until** field is filled in automatically based on your settings.
5. Add the items you want to offer. You can add new rows by pressing Enter or clicking the **plus symbol**.
6. When you are satisfied with the content, select one of the following options at the bottom of the page:
   - **Send quote via email**: The quote is sent directly to the customer's specified email address and receives the status **Sent**.
   - **Create PDF**: The document is saved as a PDF that you can print or send manually. The status changes to **Sent**.
   - **Save draft**: The quote is saved in the **Drafts** list so you can continue working on it later.

## Tips

> **Manage discounts:** If you want to give the customer a discount, you can add an item row with a minus sign in front of the quantity (e.g., -1). This causes the amount to be deducted from the total and the discount is clearly visible to the customer.

> **Attach files:** You can easily attach up to four PDF files (max 9.5 MB total) to your quote, such as product sheets or terms and conditions. Drag and drop the file directly into the window or click **Attach PDF**.

> **Customize rows:** You can change the order of your item and text rows by clicking the **three lines** to the left of the row and dragging it to the desired location.

## More information

- **Currency and language:** The language and currency displayed on the quote are controlled by the settings you have made for the customer in your customer register.
- **Domestic work and Green technology:** If you perform services eligible for tax reduction, check the **Domestic work or green technology** box to specify the type of work and calculate the deduction directly on the quote.
- **Cost centers:** If you use cost centers or cost objects, you can specify these for the entire document in the header, or per row if they should be distributed differently.
