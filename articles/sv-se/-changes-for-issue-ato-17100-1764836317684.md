# Improved Export Eligibility for Financial Years in Skatt & Bokslut

## Overview
This article explains an important update in Visma Skatt & Bokslut that refines how financial years are made available for export. This change provides more accurate control over which financial years can be exported, particularly benefiting those with a completed year-end period.

## Prerequisites
- Access to Visma Skatt & Bokslut.

## Why It Matters
This update ensures that only financial years with a completed year-end period, and which were originally entered manually or imported via a SIE1 file, are eligible for export. This leads to more precise data management and helps prevent the export of incomplete or incorrect financial year data, giving you greater confidence in your exported reports.

## How To Use It

When you prepare to export financial year data in Skatt & Bokslut, the list of available financial years in the export selection will now be more precisely filtered based on two key criteria. You do not need to take any new steps; the system will automatically present the correct options.

**New Eligibility Criteria for Export:**

A financial year will now be available for export if **both** of the following conditions are met:

1.  **Completed Year-End Period:** The financial year must have a registered and completed year-end period.
2.  **Specific Import Source:** The financial year's data must have been originally entered manually in Visma Skatt & Bokslut or imported using a SIE1 file.

**Example:**
*   If you have a financial year for 2023 that has successfully undergone its year-end process and was initially entered directly into Skatt & Bokslut (Manual Entry), it will now be correctly available for export.
*   Conversely, a financial year for 2024 that is still open (i.e., its year-end period is not yet completed) will not appear as an export option, even if its data was manually entered or imported via SIE1. This ensures you only export finalized data.

Simply navigate to your usual export function, and the system will present you with the appropriate financial years that meet these new, stricter eligibility rules.
