# Export All Data for Archiving in **{{resource:common_product_name_variable_taxation_year_end_closing}}**

## Overview

This update introduces a new feature that allows you to export all your company data in a print-friendly format. This is perfect for archiving your company records for the legally required period. The exported data is organized into a folder structure by year and period, with each period folder containing PDF files of all relevant documents. The feature is available under ****{{resource:Menu_title_Maintenance}}**** -> ****{{resource:ExportData_title_ExportData}}****, and you can choose to export data for one or multiple years.

## What Has Changed?

*   **New Export Functionality:** You can now export a complete archive copy of your data.
*   **Automatic Folder Structure:** Data is automatically organized into folders for each year, and then for each period within that year.
*   **PDF Format:** All documents are exported as PDF files, ready for printing or digital archiving.
*   **Year Selection:** You can choose to export data for a specific year or for multiple years simultaneously.
*   **Included Periods:** Only periods that have automatic checks, are marked as complete, or contain at least one comment are included in the export.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1.  Navigate to the ****{{resource:Menu_title_Maintenance}}**** menu.
2.  Select ****{{resource:ExportData_title_ExportData}}****.
3.  Choose the years you wish to export. You can select a specific year or check **All Years** to include all available years.
4.  Click the button to start the export. The button will be disabled during the export process.
5.  A progress bar will be displayed while the export is in progress, similar to the one used in **{{resource:Menu_title_ReportCenter}}**.
6.  Once the export is complete, you will receive a confirmation.
7.  If errors occur during the export (e.g., if a document has an unexpected format), a message will appear informing you that something went wrong. A message may also appear if the export partially failed but was still generated.
8.  You will receive a ZIP file containing your exported data, organized into year and period folders with PDF documents.

### Tooltips

To the right of the documentation field, there is a tooltip providing information about:
*   What the export contains.
*   That you will receive a .zip file.

## User Impact

This feature is designed to provide you with a simple and reliable method for archiving your company data. This ensures you meet legal requirements for data retention and provides you with a backup of your data before any potential deletion.
