# News: You can now use multiple invoice backgrounds

You can now upload and choose between several different invoice backgrounds directly in Spiris. This makes it easier for those who run different businesses under the same corporate identity number and want to use different graphic profiles for your mailings.

### Customize!
You can upload up to five different backgrounds for invoices, quotes, and orders. This way, you can easily change the logo or appearance depending on what you are selling, while everything is recorded in the same company.

### How to do it:
1. Go to ****{{resource:CompanySettings}}**** > ****{{resource:CompanyMiscSettings}}**** > ****{{resource:PrintThemeSettingLegend}}****.
2. Upload your background templates (maximum of 5 in png, jpg, or jpeg formats).
3. Name the backgrounds to easily find the right one in the list.
4. Select the desired background from the drop-down list when creating a new invoice, order, or quote.

### Good to know
* ****{{resource:CP_ExternalReporting_ByggLosen_title_CompanyInformation}}**:** Bank details and corporate identity number are always retrieved from your general settings, regardless of which background you choose.
* **Payment reminders:** Reminders automatically use the same background as the original invoice.
* **The mobile app:** Support for choosing a background is also being rolled out in the mobile app, so you can manage your sales with the right profile even on the go.
