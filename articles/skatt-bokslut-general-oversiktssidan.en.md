# The Overview Page

## Overview
This update gives you a clearer and more useful overview page in {{resource:common_product_name_variable_taxation_year_end_closing}}. The page is your central hub for quickly checking the progress of your reconciliation, updating accounting data, locking accounting periods, and running automatic checks.

## What has changed?
The overview page has been refreshed to give you a better overall picture of your reconciliation work. You can now clearly see how far you've come and what's next. The page adapts to your company type and selected reconciliation period, making the information especially relevant to you.

## Benefits for you
*   **Quick check:** Instantly see how much of the reconciliation is complete and what still needs to be done.
*   **Easy data management:** Update accounting data from Spiri's {{resource:Common_Product_Name_Variable_eAccStandard}} or a SIE4 file directly from the overview page.
*   **Control over periods:** Lock your accounting periods to ensure everything is correct.
*   **Automatic checks:** Run the automatic checks to find any discrepancies.

## How does it work?

### For accounting firms
If you use Tax & Year-End Closing as an accounting firm, the overview page shows the periods relevant to your subscription (Period or Year).
*   Use the **Show all periods** button to switch or view other available periods.

### For companies
If you use {{resource:common_product_name_variable_taxation_year_end_closing}} as a company, year-end closing is always active. You can choose whether or not to work with periods. You do this in the start guide or under ****{{resource:Menu_title_Maintenance}}**** and then ****{{resource:Menu_title_Maintenance_CustomerDetails}}****.

### For private individuals
If the company type is ****{{resource:StartGuide_txt_PrivatePerson}}****, the reconciliation period is always **Year**. This feature is only available when you use the service via **{{resource:Common_Product_Name_Variable_Advisor}}**.
