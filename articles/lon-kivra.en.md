# Using Kivra in Payroll

## Overview
The integration with Kivra is moving into Payroll! This means that from now on, you will manage the sending of payslips via Kivra directly within the Payroll program, instead of through a web browser. This provides a smoother and more integrated experience when sending payslips digitally.

## Prerequisites
* You are using Payroll.
* You have a subscription that includes the Kivra integration.

## Activating Kivra for Payslips in Spiris Payroll

For new customers, My Payroll/Kivra is automatically activated for all employees in the register from the start.

For existing customers who have not previously used Kivra for payslips from Spiris Payroll:

1.  The first time you click **Send Payslip** in a payroll run, it is checked if you have previously sent to My Payroll/Kivra. If not, a message is displayed to activate Kivra.
2.  In the message, you can choose to activate Kivra. Thereafter, the agreement is displayed where you approve sending payslips via Kivra.
3.  After approval, the payslips are automatically sent to Kivra.

## Managing the Kivra Agreement

Your agreement with Kivra is visible in two places for easy access:

*   Under **More Solutions** in Spiris Payroll.
*   In the current payroll run, under **Send and Post to Voucher**.

When you activate the service via "More Solutions," you can choose to approve sending either payslips, invoices, or both.

## Kivra Status and Management

1.  Go to **Send and Post to Voucher** in Spiris Payroll.
2.  Here you will find a link or button for Kivra.
    *   If you have not previously approved the agreement, it will be displayed for approval.
    *   If you have already approved the agreement, you will be taken to a Kivra status page where you can see information about the previous month's dispatches.
3.  On the status page, you can also choose to discontinue the use of Kivra.

## For Existing Kivra Users Sending from Spiris Payroll

If you have previously sent payslips to Kivra from Spiris Web Payroll (VLA) and are now doing so from Spiris Payroll (VLS) for the first time, a message will be displayed. The message informs you that the Kivra status page has moved to Spiris Payroll.

## Future Improvements
We are investigating the possibility of displaying the status for both My Payroll and Kivra on the same page for an even better overview.

## Important to Know
*   Once the Kivra integration has been moved from VLA to Payroll, the agreement and status page will no longer be visible in VLA.
*   To activate communication between VLS and Kivra, contact with Kivra may be required.
