# Reset Company in Tax & Closing

## Overview
Sometimes things go wrong, and that's perfectly okay. Maybe you've imported the wrong file or just want a fresh start with a financial year. With this feature, you can easily delete all data for the active company and year, allowing you to start over from scratch.

Keep in mind that this action is permanent and **cannot be undone**. All information for the selected year, such as basic details and imported data, will be deleted.

## How to reset a company
Follow these steps to delete all data for the active company.

1.  Go to the **File** menu at the top of the page.
2.  Select the **Reset Company** option.
3.  A warning dialog will appear to ensure you don't delete everything by mistake. To confirm, type the company's name exactly as it appears in the box.
4.  Click the **Reset** button.

All data for the company is now deleted, and you can start over, for example, by importing a new SIE file.
