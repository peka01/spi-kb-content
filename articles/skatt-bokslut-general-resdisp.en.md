# Managing Appropriation of Profit/Loss in the Year-End Closing

## Overview
We have now made it even easier for you to manage the company's profit or loss during the year-end closing process. In the new view for appropriation of profit/loss, you get a clear overview and can smoothly decide how a profit or loss should be distributed. This gives you full control and makes an important part of the year-end closing both faster and more secure.

## How the Appropriation of Profit/Loss View Works
The view is divided into three parts that clearly show what funds are available, how you propose they should be distributed, and what the final result will be.

### 1. Funds Available for Appropriation
Here you see a summary of the capital available for distribution at the end of the year. It usually consists of:
*   **Retained earnings from the previous year:** Profit or loss carried over from previous years.
*   **Profit/loss for the year:** The company's profit or loss for the current financial year.

The sum of these constitutes the total funds that the Annual General Meeting can decide on.

### 2. Proposed Appropriation
This is where you decide what will happen to the available funds. You have several options for distributing the profit/loss:
*   **Enter dividend to shareholders:** In the dividend field, you enter the amount you propose to be distributed.
*   **Transfer to a fund for development expenditure:** If the company has capitalized development expenditure, you can appropriate a corresponding amount from unrestricted equity here.
*   **Manage tax allocation reserves:** You can make appropriations to a tax allocation reserve to defer taxation, or reverse funds from an existing reserve.
*   **Carry forward as retained earnings:** The funds remaining after your selections are automatically transferred to next year's equity. The amount is calculated instantly as you fill in the other fields, so you can always see what the distribution looks like.

### 3. After Appropriation
This section summarizes the result of your proposal. Here, the new retained earnings are displayed—that is, the equity the company carries forward into the next financial year. Everything is updated in real-time based on the choices you make.

**Example:**
The company has a profit of 100,000 and 50,000 in retained earnings from the previous year. In total, there are 150,000 available for appropriation. You propose a dividend of 75,000 and simultaneously make an appropriation to a tax allocation reserve of 25,000. You will then immediately see in the view that the remaining 50,000 is carried forward as new retained earnings to the next year.
