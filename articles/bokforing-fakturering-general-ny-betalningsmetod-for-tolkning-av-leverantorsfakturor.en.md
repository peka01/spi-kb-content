# New Payment Method for Supplier Invoice Interpretation

## Overview
Starting in 2025, we are simplifying our business model for receiving and interpreting supplier invoices. Going forward, a transaction fee will be charged each time you post a supplier invoice that has been interpreted. This applies regardless of how the invoice was received.

## What Has Changed?
Previously, we charged for e-invoices and documents sent directly to your source invoice address. Invoices photographed or imported in other ways were free of charge, despite having the same value for your accounting.

To create a unified business model for all types of received purchase invoices, we are introducing a transaction fee for interpreted invoices. The fee is charged when you post an interpreted supplier invoice.

### Invoices Affected by the Change:
*   Invoices sent via email to your source invoice address.
*   Invoices photographed with the Scanner app (or later in the Spiris app).
*   Invoices uploaded via drag-and-drop or import function.
*   Invoices received via email with the older Scanner function.
*   Invoices received from Kivra (new from Q2 2025).

For invoicing, the same article is used as for digitally received documents: **ER.DIGITAL.DOC**. This article belongs to the category "Digital invoices and documents".

As an accounting firm, you can choose to cover the transaction costs, just as you can today.

## What Does This Mean for You?
When you post a supplier invoice that has been interpreted, a transaction cost will be charged. This applies regardless of how the invoice was originally received.

We are also adjusting the fee for existing workflows where invoices are sent to your source invoice address via email, so that the cost is handled in the same way when the invoice is posted.
