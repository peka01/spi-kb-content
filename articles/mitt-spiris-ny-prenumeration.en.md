# New Subscription in **{{resource:Common_Company_Name_Short}}**

## Overview
This text describes updates to the page where you manage your subscription in Mitt Spiris. The goal is to make it easier to see what your subscription costs, which features you have, and how you can add more users or services.

## Prerequisites
*   You must be logged into Spiris.
*   You must have an active subscription.

## What Has Changed?

We have improved the page where you manage your subscription to make it easier to add more users and features. You will also get a clearer view of costs, and the design is more aligned with the rest of Spiris' services.

Here are the main changes:

### Clearer Cost Information
*   **Cost of the basic subscription:** Now displayed directly under the name of your subscription, for example, "XXX SEK/month".
*   **Cost breakdown:** A new section called "Your subscription" shows a breakdown of the costs.
    *   If you have included user licenses, this will be shown, for example, "1 license included, X licenses cost 99 SEK/month/user".
*   **Total cost:** The total monthly cost is clearly displayed after a line.
*   **Subscription period:** Information about how long your subscription is valid and when it expires, for example, "Subscription period: 12 months", "Valid until: 2026-12-12".

### Manage User Licenses
*   A new button and section have been added to make it easy for you to add more users. Click "Add user license" to see the price per user and then "Add".

### Explore and Add Services
*   Under the heading "Available services," you can now see and select more features that can expand your subscription. Each service has a description and a monthly price:
    *   ****{{resource:Common_Product_Name_Variable_eTaxLimitedLiab}}**:** To finalize your financial statements, digitally sign the annual report, and send the information directly to the Swedish Companies Registration Office and the Swedish Tax Agency. Cost: XXX SEK/month.
    *   ****{{resource:Common_Product_Name_Variable_eAccQuoteOrder}}**** Create quotes and orders for your customers. Then easily convert them into invoices! Cost: XXX SEK/month.
    *   ****{{resource:common_product_name_variable_eaccapi}}**:** Securely connect one or more programs with your accounting and invoicing. Read more about integrations. Cost: XXX SEK/month.
    *   ****{{resource:Common_Product_Name_Variable_eAccStock}}**:** Get smart inventory management with features like automatic adjustments and easy updating of inventory values in your bookkeeping. Avoid duplicate work and gain full control! Cost: XXX SEK/month.
*   Click "Select" to add a service you are interested in.

### Cancel Subscription
*   Buttons to cancel or undo the cancellation of your subscription are now on the page. The buttons function as before but have a new appearance.
*   If you cannot cancel the subscription directly via the page, an information icon will be displayed with the text: "To cancel your subscription, please contact us at 0470-70 60 00".

### Design and Responsiveness
*   The subscription card has new margins and size to better fit into Spiris' design.
*   The page now automatically adapts to your screen, whether you are using a computer, tablet, or mobile.
