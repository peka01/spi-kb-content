# Frequently Asked Questions about Invoice Backgrounds

Here we have gathered the most common questions about how to use multiple invoice backgrounds in **Spiris**. This feature is perfect for those who run multiple businesses or brands under the same organization number and want your invoices to look different depending on what you are selling.

### Can I have different looks for my invoices for different parts of my business?
Yes, absolutely! You can now add up to five different backgrounds for your sales documents. This means you can have a unique layout for, for example, a specific brand or a seasonal part of your business, even though everything is recorded in the same company in our financial platform.

### How do I add a new invoice background?
It is easy to get started and upload your own designs. Follow these steps:

1. Go to **Settings** and select **Company Settings**.
2. Click on **Other Settings** and then on **Print Settings**.
3. Here you can upload up to five different background images. 
4. Give each background a clear name in the text field so that you can easily recognize them when invoicing.

### Which file formats can I use for my background?
For best results, you should use image files in **PNG**, **JPG**, or **JPEG** formats. Previously, PDF files were supported, but for new uploads, image formats are required to ensure your documents look good in all situations.

### How do I choose which background to use on an invoice?
When you create a new sales invoice, order, or quote, there is now a dropdown list in the view. There you simply select the name you gave your background, and it will be applied directly to the document. 

### Can I link a specific background to a certain customer?
Currently, you select the background manually each time you create a document. There is not yet a setting to pre-select a specific background directly on a customer card, but we are constantly working to make the platform even smoother.

### What happens with payment reminders?
Payment reminders automatically use the same background that was used on the original invoice. You therefore do not need to make any extra selection for the reminder to look consistent.

### Can I have different Bankgiro numbers for the different backgrounds?
No, the platform currently retrieves bank details based on your company settings and what is selected for the customer. A tip if you want to show a different account number is to include that information directly in your graphic background image.
