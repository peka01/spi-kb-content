# Manage Tax Allocation Reserves

## Overview
Do you need to make an allocation to a tax allocation reserve or reverse an old one? With the schedule for tax allocation reserves, you get full control of your reserves and ensure everything is correctly entered in the tax calculation. It's a smart way to even out your taxes between good and less good years.

This guide shows you how to fill out the schedule to manage your allocations and reversals directly in Spiris.

## How to Fill Out the Schedule

The schedule gives you a clear overview of your existing tax allocation reserves and helps you calculate this year's allocation and reversal.

1.  **Review previous allocations**  
    When you open the schedule, you will see a summary of the allocations you have made in previous income years. Verify that the information is correct.

2.  **Reverse reserves**  
    The oldest reserve must be reversed for taxation. The amount is usually filled in automatically. You can also choose to voluntarily reverse all or parts of other reserves. Enter the amounts in the reversal fields for each respective year.

3.  **Make a new allocation**  
    At the bottom of the schedule, you will see the basis for this year's possible allocation. Enter the amount you want to set aside in the field for this year's allocation. The platform helps you keep track of the maximum amount.

4.  **Check the summary**  
    The schedule automatically summarizes your total reversals and your new allocation. These values are then automatically transferred to the correct fields on your income tax return, so you don't have to enter them manually. Done!
