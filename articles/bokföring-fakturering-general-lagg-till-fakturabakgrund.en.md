# Use different invoice backgrounds-TEST2

If your company has several different brands or business branches under the same organization number, you can customize the appearance of your documents. With this feature, you can upload and choose between up to five different backgrounds to give your invoices, orders, and quotes the correct graphic profile.

## How to do it

### Upload and name a background

1. Go to **Settings** in the menu and select **Company settings**.
2. Click on **Other settings** and select **Print settings**.
3. Upload your files under the section for invoice background. You can use the formats **.png**, **.jpg**, or **.jpeg**.
4. Give each background a clear name in the text field so you can easily recognize them in the list.
5. Click **Save**.

### Select background when creating a document

1. Create a new **Customer invoice**, **Order**, or **Quote**.
2. Select the template you want to use in the dropdown list for background. 
3. Check that the layout for the current document is updated immediately.
4. Send or print the document as usual.

## Tips
> Payment reminders automatically use the same background as the original invoice, so you do not need to make any manual selection for these.

> Bank details such as account number and IBAN are normally retrieved from the settings on the specific customer. If you want to show different bank accounts for different brands, you can include these details directly in the graphic background file that you upload.
